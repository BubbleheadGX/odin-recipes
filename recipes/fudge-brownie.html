  <p>The following is a recipe for fudge brownies! They are simple to make and way better than boxed brownie mix.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>120g <strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong></li>
      <li>1/2 Teaspoon <strong>Baking Powder</strong></li>
      <li>1/2 Teaspoon <strong>Salt</strong></li>
      <li>43g <strong>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder</strong></li>
      <li>170g <strong>Unsalted Butter</strong></li>
      <li>28ml <strong>Vegetable Oil</strong></li>
      <li>265g <strong>Granulated Sugar</strong></li>
      <li>2 <strong>Large Eggs</strong></li>
      <li>1 <strong>Large Egg Yolk</strong></li>
      <li>2 Teaspoons <strong>Vanilla Extract</strong></li>
      <li>128g <strong>Chocolate Chips</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F) (175 degreed C). Line an 9Ã—9-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Spray lightly with non-stick baking spray and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, and espresso powder. Set aside until needed.</li>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, oil, and 1/3 cup of the sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until butter is completely melted. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolk, vanilla, and remaining sugar. Whisk until well combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Slowly, pour the warm butter mixture into the egg mixture, adding it very gradually and whisking constantly until completely combined.</li>
      <li>Add in the dry ingredients and chocolate chips and, using a rubber spatula, slowly stir until just combined.</li>
      <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.</li>
      <li>Bake for 28 (to 30 minutes) or until the edges are firm and the top is shiny and slightly cracked.</li>
      <li>Place pan on a cooling rack and cool completely before slicing.</li>
  </ol>
